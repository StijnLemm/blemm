# BLEMM, build lazy
This stb styled single header library is aimed to make "MakeFiles" using the c compiler. For instance, you only need the C compiler if you want to build a C only project, instead of needing Make, CMake of other project managers.

## Usage
Simply do:
```
cc blemm.c -o blemm
```
### Aim for usage
After that, it is possible to only use ```./blemm``` to build the build script and your project.
